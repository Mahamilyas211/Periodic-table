# Periodic Table of the Elements

This project is a responsive Periodic Table of the Elements created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The data for the elements is sourced from the [Periodic-Table-JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON) repository, which is licensed under the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) license.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The periodic table is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on any device.
- **Data-Driven**: All element data is dynamically loaded from a JSON file, providing a structured and consistent display of the periodic table.
- **Interactive**: The table allows for interaction and easy identification of elements based on their properties.
